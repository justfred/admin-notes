"Control component"
  Inputs are linked to actions
  In React, input components (think user interaction) must have a defined behavior. The value that is displayed in a text box must be linked to a variable, and have a function that defines how updating that field works. Because the code defines all this behavior, these components are referred to as controlled components in React.

"Single source of truth"
  Only define things once, at the necessary level
