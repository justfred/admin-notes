AWS Notes

Shared Responisbility
  Amazon - physical and hosted server stuff
  User - operating system level stuff

IAM
  Identity Access and Management
  Control users and roles
  Users and groups - Who
  Roles - where
  Policies - what

IAM Configuration
  FrederickHeald
  Access Key: AKIAJMMTYGCYHVUH7X7A

Don't use root accounts for management
Manage groups instead of users

Google Authenicator
  Software for phone

S3
  Object storage - only modify entire objects
  (Block storage - more traditional, modify smaller blocks - like a volume in AWS)
  Heavy on exam
  Durability - 11x9s 99.999999999
    Can tolerate the loss of two physical facilities
  Availability - 4x9s 99.99
  Versioning
  Buckets
    Region
    DNS name
  Data Consistency
    Immediate read-after-write consistency
    DOES NOT guarantee for overwrites - eventual consistency
  Tiers/Storage Classes
    S3 Standard
    S3IA Infrequent Access
      Same specs
      Cheaper to store
      For data you don't access often
      Retrieval fee
    Reduced Redundancy
      99.99 durability
      Loss of one data center
      For objects that might tolerate loss
      More expensive than standard (prices were adjusted?)
    Glacier
      Archiving in the cloud
      Cheap and slow
      Data retrieval can be slow
  Security
    Access can be logged
  Encryption
    In transit
    At rest
      Server side encryption
        SSE-S3
        SSE-KMS (customer key)
        SSE-C (custom)
      Client side encryption
  Versioning
    Restore points for files stored in the Buckets
    Increases storage space
    Once it's on you can't turn it off
  Cross-region replication
  LifeCycle Management
    Rules for file management and cleanup

Cloudfront
  Content delivery
  Route 53, AWS hosted DNS service

Storage Gateway
  Virtual appliance runs locally
  The most active data is cached locally
  Hybrid cloud architecture
  Mount S3 storage from local machines
    NFS/NAS replication?
    sudo mount_nfs -o vers=3,nolock -v [Your gateway VM IP address:/] [S3 bucket name] [client drive name]
  iSCSI
    block-level storage
    can be used as a vm or boot volume
  Volume Gateway
    Gateway (software appliance) is on premise
    Stored Volume Mode
      Restore points located in S3
    Cached Volume Mode
      Data stored in S3, local is a cached location
      Low latency access
    Tape Gateway
      Inexpensive backup solution to Glacier
      Required a virtual appliance
Migration
  Import/Export Disk
    Large amounts of data quickly
    Portable storage device
    Not the way Amazon would prefer
  Snowball
    Physical appliance
    Rent the hardware
    Petabyte scale disk transfer
    50tb per Snowball
    Only works with S3
  Snowball Edge
  Snowmobile
  Transfer Accelleration
    Uses CloudFront Edge Locations, AWS backhauls it to S3 bucket
    Transfer Speed Comparison Tool
    Just enable it on a bucket
    Supports multi-part buckets

VMs, Hosts, and Hypervisors
  Virtual Machines running on physical servers
  Hypervisor - share memory, cpu, network resources for multiple VMs
  Amazon EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud
  EC2 Instance is a virtual server
  Scalable
  On-demand instances
    Workloads go up and down
    More expensive
    Traditionally pay-per-hour, now pay-per-second, 1-minute minimum.
  Reserved Instances
    1-year (breakeven 5 months) or 3-year (breakeven 3 year)
    C3, C4, C5 - different capabilities, upgradable
    Convertible reserved instance
  Spot Instance
    Saving money
    Pop-up
    Cheaper than on demand
    Prices fluctuate
    Automatically terminated if price exceeds bid
    Price varies by availability zone
    90% less than on demand
  Different types of EC2
  Elastic Block Store - EBS
    "Disks" for EC2 instances
    Formatted with file system
    IOPs - Input/output Operations Per Second
    SSD - "Bursting" supports variable demand
    Larger volume, more IOPS
    Bursting credits
    gp2 - General purpose SSD
      Bursting
    io1 - Provisioned IOPS SSD
      IO intensive workloads
      Consistent performance
    st1 - Throughput optimized HDD
      Cannot boot
      Large, sequential workloads
    sc1 - Cold HD
      Lowest cost
      Bursting
