Best Practices

Projects
  -Put everything in a consistent place.

Git
  -Start a new git project at the start; check in at every point
  -add and commit
    git config --global alias.a '!git add -A && git commit -m'
    then
    git a 'message'
    Create a github repo and push code there too
    Name the github remote github

Test driven development
  -write tests (that will fail) before writing code that will
  -always test for errors first.

Semicolons at the end of line?

Keep notes on global config/dependencies
  npm -g

Keep track of workflows and test them regularly

When checking for errors within an if/then, always check for error first.
  if (error) {
    //handle
  } else {
    //normal
  }

Magic numbers
  Don't use magic numbers anywhere.  This means you.

Languages
  Don't use magic strings; use a language file.

Secrets
  Should be in environment variables or external files
