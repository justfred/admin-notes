Best Practices

Projects
  -Put everything in a consistent place.

Git
  -Start a new git project at the start; check in at every point
  -add and commit
    git config --global alias.a '!git add -A && git commit -m'
    then
    git a 'message'
    Create a github repo and push code there too
    Name the github remote github

Test driven development
  -write tests (that will fail) before writing code that will
  -always test for errors first.

Semicolons at the end of line?

Keep notes on global config/dependencies
  npm -g

Keep track of workflows and test them regularly

When checking for errors within an if/then, always check for error first.
  if (error) {
    //handle
  } else {
    //normal
  }

Magic numbers
  Don't use magic numbers anywhere.  This means you.
  Put numbers in master or config files, then use as constants.

Languages
  Don't use magic strings; use a language file.

Secrets
  Should be in environment variables or external files

Business Logic
  Don't put business logic in view layer, if possible.  Calculations should be in model or controller, not view.

Least powerful denominator
  When possible, make variables as "weak" as possible.  Local or const when possible.
